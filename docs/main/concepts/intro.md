# Explaining t3rn

This section covers the t3rn in greater detail, explaining how different components of the t3rn circuit function and what they rely on. The goal of the following articles is a good understanding of the underlying mechanics that enable the functionality offered by t3rn.

### [The Gateway](gateway/types.md)

The gateway is a core component of the t3rn circuit, enabling the interoperability provided by t3rn. The articles of this section will cover the different aspects of the gateway, explaining the functionality it enables and the cryptographic proofs it relies on to remain trustless and decentralized.



### [Transaction Reversibility](category/reversibility)

A core feature of t3rn is the reversibility of cross-chain transactions. In this section, we will explain how this reversibility is achieved and what different approaches exist.
