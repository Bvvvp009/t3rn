# t3rn Gateway Registration Script:
This repo contains the example code used for registering the rococo testnet as a gateway on the t3rn circuit. For the informed user, the general logic and required parameters are self explainatory. The documentation for this can be found [here](https://paul-1.gitbook.io/t3rn-docs/getting-started/register-gateway). 
## Requirements and Installation:
- ensure npx is installed `npm i -g npx`
- run `yarn install`
- run `npx ts-node register.ts` for execution

# Register your Gateway:
As the registration function is currently protected, it is required to be executed by a member of the t3rn team. To register your gateway, fork this repository, change the registration parameters and submit them as a pull request. A member of the t3rn team will review them and execute them.
