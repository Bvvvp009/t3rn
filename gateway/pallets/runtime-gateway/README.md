# Pallet Runtime Gateway 

This pallet can be used as an extension to any parachain that comes along with its own sandboxed wasm execution engine - `versatile-wasm`. 

The pallet allows for the `multistep_call` - execution following t3rn protocol that differentiates the execution contracts into 3 phases - `execute`, `revert`, `commit`. The execution is facilitated via escrow account that holds the execution proofs & deferred results as serves as a callee to operative contract calls. The deferred results are not commited to target accounts until the `commit` phase. 

The mechanics and which authorising certain operations to be dispatched via gateway on a given parachain are facilitated by `verstaile-wasm`. Parachain can also implements a `DispatchRuntimeCalls` trait to open up the resources of of internal modules for external execution via contract-like calls. That's demonstrated in [storage_runtime_demo.wat](../contracts-gateway/fixtures/32b-account-and-u128-balance/storage_runtime_demo.wat) and [demo-runtime](../../node). It can also be disabled by importing and using ``versatile_wasm::DisableStorageDispatchRuntimeCall``.


## Installation

##### [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/blob/development/gateway/demo-runtime/runtime/Cargo.toml)

_Currently `v2.0.0` version of substrate is supported._

Installation of `RuntimeGateway` requires satisfying traits of other pallets which need to be added into the `Cargo.toml` of that parachain's runtime:
```rust,nofmt
[dependencies.pallet-sudo]
default-features = false
git = 'https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git'
version = '2.0.0'

[dependencies.versatile-wasm]
default-features = false
git = 'https://github.com/t3rn/gateway-pallet.git'
version = "0.3.0"
```

##### Runtime [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/blob/development/gateway/demo-runtime/runtime/src/lib.rs)

##### Implement Traits

Implement `Trait` for `sudo` and `escrow_gateway_balances` (that comes with two traits: `EscrowTrait` for common escrow features - transfers and the actual `Trait` that provides sandboxed runtime execution of WASM code:

```rust
// substrate-node-template implements sudo already.
impl pallet_sudo::Trait for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type Call = Call;
}

impl runtime_gateway::EscrowTrait for Runtime {
	type Currency = Balances;
	type Time = Timestamp;
}

impl versatile_wasm::VersatileWasm for Runtime {
    type DispatchRuntimeCall = versatile_wasm::DisableStorageDispatchRuntimeCall;
    type Event = Event;
    type Call = Call;
    type Randomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
}

impl runtime_gateway::Trait for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
}
```

###### Add pallets to "construct_runtime!"
Add both `VerastileWasm` and `RuntimeGateway` in your `construct_runtime!` macro:
```rust
RuntimeGateway: runtime_gateway::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
VersatileWasm: versatile_wasm::{Module, Call, Event<T>},
```


## Interface
#### multistep_call
##### Parameters
```rust
fn multistep_call (
    origin: Origin,         // Origin source of a call; should be the escrow account owner.
    requester: T::AccountId,   // Account requesting the execution.
    target_dest: T::AccountId, // Target that the call is addressed to (can be an account or a contract)
    phase: u8,              // Current execution phase (execute = 0, revert = 1, commit = 2).
    code: Vec<u8>,          // Code of the package/contract as hex encode .wasm.
    input_data: Vec<u8>,    // Input data for a call to the instantiated code.
    value: BalanceOf<T>,    // Transferred value accompanying the call.
    gas_limit: Gas,         // Gas limit for processing the overall tx (instantiate + call).
) -> dispatch::DispatchResult
```
##### Description
Executes provided package within the multi-phase context. Invokes several methods of Contracts Pallet underneath: `put-code`, `instantiate` and `bare_call` in order to execute the package on the fly.
Depending on the `phase` invokes different behaviour: 
- Execute: Code results are stored on escrow account under corresponding to the call storage key.
- Revert:  Code results are removed out of escrow account.
- Commit:  Code results are moved from escrow account to target accounts.
