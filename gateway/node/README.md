# Demo Runtime Node

This is a FRAME-based Substrate Demo Runtime Node that is built after [`substrate-template-node`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template). Please follow the docs at the [template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) to learn on the pre-requisites, installation & development.

It's purpose is to demonstrate the setup of t3rn gateway pallets with both [`contracts-gateway`](../pallets/contracts-gateway) and [`runtime-gateway`](../pallets/runtime-gateway). In the non-demo circumstances developers would rather choose to integrate with only one of the pallet, depending on the parachain's purpose.

## What's extra inside?

Extra pallets installed in `Cargo.toml`'s runtime:
```rust
// Following 2 installed normally for parachains with contracts
contracts = { package = "pallet-contracts", default-features = false, version = '2.0.0' }
contracts-gateway = { package = "pallet-contracts-gateway", default-features = false, version = '0.3.0',  git = 'https://github.com/t3rn/gateway-pallet.git', branch = 'master' }
// Following 2 installed normally for parachains without contracts that still want to support execution of attached contracts via `runtime-gateway`
runtime-gateway = { package = "pallet-runtime-gateway", default-features = false, version = '0.3.0', git = 'https://github.com/t3rn/gateway-pallet.git', branch = 'master' }
versatile-wasm = { default-features = false, version = '0.3.0', git = 'https://github.com/t3rn/gateway-pallet.git', branch = 'master'  }
// Only to demonstrate dispatches to runtime 
weights = { default-features = false, version = '2.0.0', git = 'https://github.com/t3rn/gateway-pallet.git', branch = 'master' }
```

Additional modules instantiated via `construct_runtime!` macro:
```rust
// Parachains with contracts pallet
Contracts: contracts::{Module, Call, Config, Storage, Event<T>},
ContractsGateway: contracts_gateway::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
// Parachains without contracts pallet
RuntimeGateway: runtime_gateway::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
VersatileWasm: versatile_wasm::{Module, Call, Event<T>},
// That's a Weights pallet which is here only to demonstrate dispatches to runtime via VersatileWasm
Weights: weights::{Module, Call},
```

The `contracts-gateway` traits are implemented by runtime:
```rust
impl gateway_escrow_engine::EscrowTrait for Runtime {
    type Currency = Balances;
    type Time = Timestamp;
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const WhenStateChangedForceTry: bool = false;
}

impl contracts_gateway::Trait for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type WhenStateChangedForceTry = WhenStateChangedForceTry;
}
```

The demonstration of the dispatches runtime calls is also taking place in `runtime/src/lib.rs`. Here, to addition to all of the standard operations supported by `versatile-wasm`, three functions from the `Weights` pallet can be reached by executed contracts: `store_value`, `double`, `complex_calucations`.

```rust
impl weights::Trait for Runtime {}
pub type WeightsCall = weights::Call<Runtime>;

pub struct DemoStorageDispatchRuntimeCall;

impl versatile_wasm::DispatchRuntimeCall<Runtime> for DemoStorageDispatchRuntimeCall {
    fn dispatch_runtime_call(
        module_name: &str,
        fn_name: &str,
        _input: &[u8],
        escrow_account: &<Runtime as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId,
        _requested: &<Runtime as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId,
        _callee: &<Runtime as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId,
        _value: BalanceOf<Runtime>,
        gas_meter: &mut versatile_wasm::gas::GasMeter<Runtime>,
    ) -> DispatchResult {
        match (module_name, fn_name) {
            ("Weights", "store_value") => {
                let decoded_input: u32 = match Decode::decode(&mut _input.clone()) {
                    Ok(dec) => dec,
                    Err(_) => {
                        return Err(DispatchError::Other(
                            "Can't decode input for Weights::store_value. Expected u32.",
                        ));
                    }
                };
                gas_meter.charge_runtime_dispatch(Box::new(Call::Weights(
                    WeightsCall::store_value(decoded_input),
                )))?;
                // Alternatively use the call - call.dispatch((Origin::signed(*escrow_account))).map_err(|e| e.error)?;
                Weights::store_value(Origin::signed(escrow_account.clone()), decoded_input)
            }
            ("Weights", "double") => {
                let decoded_input: u32 = match Decode::decode(&mut _input.clone()) {

                        return Err(DispatchError::Other(
                            "Can't decode input for Weights::store_value. Expected u32.",
                        ));
                    }
                };
                gas_meter.charge_runtime_dispatch(Box::new(Call::Weights(WeightsCall::double(

                    Err(_) => {

                        ));
                    }
                };
                gas_meter.charge_runtime_dispatch(Box::new(Call::Weights(

impl versatile_wasm::VersatileWasm for Runtime {

}

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the node template. This command will build the
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Single Node Development Chain

Purge any existing dev chain state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start a dev chain:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Or, start a dev chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action, refer to
[our Start a Private Network tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network/).

### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command (`cargo build --release && ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev

# Check whether the code is compilable
./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check
```
